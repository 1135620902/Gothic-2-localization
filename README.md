# Gothic 2 Localization
Localization of Gothic 2 Night of the Raven scripts. Scripts based on https://github.com/VaanaCZ/gothic-2-addon-scripts with no functional script changes, only optimized for translation. 

The goal is to provide consistent compiled scripts and output units (spoken dialogue) for Gothic, that share the same code base.
# Languages

## :de: German
German is the source language, made by Piranha Bytes. It is open to changes, in case some typos are found.  
> Due to the nature of Daedalus scripts, especially the `TEXT` string arrays in item instances, the German translation status reports number less than 100%, when in fact it is 100% translated.
