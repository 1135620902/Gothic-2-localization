# Gothic 2 Localization
Localization of Gothic 2 Night of the Raven scripts. Scripts based on https://github.com/VaanaCZ/gothic-2-addon-scripts with no functional script changes, only optimized for translation. 

The goal is to provide consistent compiled scripts and output units (spoken dialogue) for Gothic, that share the same code base.
