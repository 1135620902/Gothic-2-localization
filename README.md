# Gothic 2 Localization
Localization of Gothic 2 Night of the Raven scripts. Scripts based on https://github.com/VaanaCZ/gothic-2-addon-scripts with no functional script changes, only optimized for translation. 

The goal is to provide consistent compiled scripts and output units (spoken dialogue) for Gothic, that share the same code base.

# Contributing
New translations and corrections of existing translations happen on my instance of [weblate](https://weblate.cokoliv.eu/projects/gothic-2-night-of-the-raven/). If you wish to help with corrections, translations or you want to translate Gothic 2 Night of the Raven into new language let me know by opening an issue, sending me a message on GitHub or, preferably, on our [GMC discord server](https://discord.gg/7zjNpVN8H6).
